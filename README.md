# odin-recipes

This is a project from "The Odin Project" where I had to build a basic recipe website. The website has a main index page with links to three other pages for three different recipes. For each of these recipe pages, there is a recipe name heading, an image of the finished dish, a brief description, a list of ingredients and the steps for making the dish.

The skills demonstrated in this project are the following:
 - Making use of the Linux command line
 - Creating HTML files
 - Organizing files into folders
 - Using indentation for more readable code
 - Writing an HTML boilerplate
 - Using text elements
 - Using lists, both unordered and ordered
 - Linking to other pages from the index
 - Displaying images
 - Creating and cloning GitHub repositories
 - Applying version control using git
 - Optimizing commit messages
 - Identifying and correcting typos and careless errors
 - Researching for content
 - Citing sources
 - Publishing the project using GitHub Pages
