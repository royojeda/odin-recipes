  <img src="https://img.sunset02.com/sites/default/files/image/recipes/su/11/grilled-pork-chops-su-x.jpg">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These are especially good in the fall, using ripe, sweet, end-of-season fruit—the spice mixture really pops. You can make the recipe with peaches instead if you like.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 bone-in pork chops (each about 8 oz. and 3/4 in. thick)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 pound firm-ripe plums, halved and pitted</li>
    <li>1/2 sweet onion, cut crosswise into 1/4-in.-thick slices</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat grill to high (450° to 550°). Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Cook coriander and mustard seeds in a medium saucepan in 1 tsp. oil over high heat until mustard seeds begin to pop, 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in ginger, vinegar, and brown sugar; set aside.</li>
    <li>Grill pork chops, turning once, until cooked medium, about 10 minutes total. Brush plums and onion with remaining 2 tsp. oil. Grill onion, turning once, until softened and slightly charred, 8 to 10 minutes. Grill plums, turning once, until grill marks appear, 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer onion and plums to a cutting board and cut pieces in half. Toss in pan with reserved spice mixture and serve over pork chops.</li>
  </ol>
