  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The key to good kebabs is using very lean but tender meat; the top round is ideal (ask your butcher to cut it for you). A simple raita—a sauce of yogurt with chopped cucumber and mint—goes well with this, as does naan flatbread warmed on the grill.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 medium zuchini</li>
    <li>2 red bell peppers</li>
    <li>1/4 cup plain Greek-style yogurt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, plus sprigs for serving</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 1/4 pounds lamb top round or sirloin, cut into 1-in. chunks</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a grill to high (about 450° to 550°). Cut zucchini and bell peppers into chunks about 1 in. wide. In a large bowl, stir together yogurt, chopped cilantro, garam masala, salt, curry powder, cayenne, lemon juice, and oil. Add lamb and vegetables and toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Thread lamb and vegetables onto 8 (10 in.) metal skewers, keeping some space between the pieces to help them cook evenly.</li>
    <li>Grill skewers until beginning to char and easy to turn, about 5 minutes, then turn as needed until lamb is medium-rare and vegetables are lightly charred but still tender-crisp, 8 to 10 minutes total.</li>
    <li>Transfer skewers to a platter and top with cilantro sprigs.</li>
  </ol>
